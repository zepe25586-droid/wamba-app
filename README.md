# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
Firestore is now local-only: the project uses a local Firestore adapter that persists data in your browser's localStorage for local development and testing. See `docs/local-emulator.md` for details.
